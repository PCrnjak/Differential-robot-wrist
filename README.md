# Differential-robot-wrist

Due the high demand to built this awesome differential mechanism we decided to open source it even in this early stage.<br />
**Note that this is test fixture that we designed to test the mechanism for our future robots! Also note that this project is based on our motor driver product called [Spectral micro BLDC driver](https://source-robotics.com/products/spectral-micro-bldc-controller)**

# How to make it?

Step 1 - Source all the parts from the [BOM](https://github.com/PCrnjak/Differential-robot-wrist/tree/main/BOM) <br />
Step 2 - print all the parts in [STL folder](https://github.com/PCrnjak/Differential-robot-wrist/tree/main/STLS) (Note that some parts need to be printed twice) <br />
Step 3 - Assemble the differential and [calibrate the drivers](https://source-robotics.github.io/Spectral-BLDC-docs/) <br />
Step 4 - Program and test it! <br />
Step 5 - Enjoy your differential mechanisam! <br />
